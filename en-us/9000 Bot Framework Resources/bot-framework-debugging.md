## Building a bot and need to debug?
Building any software requires debugging, and bots are no exception. They're additionally complex to diagnose once they are running in the cloud
and endpoints are protected with security keys. There are a number of tools at your disposal to make diagnosing your bot easier.

## The Bot Framework Emulator


## Azure Application Insights


## Using a port redirector to debug locally as if your bot was deployed to the cloud

[Install the Windows Emulator](https://aka.ms/bf-bc-emulator)
 
See an example of use in the [Getting started page](/en-us/csharp/builder/sdkreference/gettingstarted.html#emulator).
